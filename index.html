			<h2>Hey there, I'm <span style="color: tomato">David</span>.</h2>
			<br>
			<p>I enjoy solving complex problems, adapting and learning new techniques.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The world is filled with plenty of inefficient systems and I believe our job as developers, engineers and designers is to come up with better solutions that haven't been thought of previously.</p>
			<br>
			<p> Many people dislike change however I believe we must <span style="color: tomato;">adapt</span> and <span style="color: tomato;">evolve</span> to be able to solve these complex problems. </p>

			<h2>Hey there, I'm David</h2>
			<p>There are many things I enjoy such as solving complex problems, adapting and learning new technologies, enjoying new experiences, good food and watching One Piece.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The World is filled with plenty of inefficient systems and I believe our job as developers, engineers and designers is to come up with better solutions not previously thought of. Many people dislike change however I believe we must <b>adapt</b> to be able to solve these complex problems. </p>
